    %h4 Data cleanup and analysis
    %p
      When you open your data to the rest of the world, wonderful and unexpected things can happen. Developers build useful tools around them, and everyone benefits. DataMade can help guide you through the process of cleaning up, 
      %a{:href => 'https://github.com/open-city/dedupe/wiki'} de-duplicating 
      and releasing your data to make it easily accessible for developers, all while keeping sensitive information secure.

    %p
